      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello internet! My name is Jason Figueroa, I am a passionate computer 
        person based in Nashville, TN. I’m currently focusing on web development 
        while attending Nashville Software School. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I grew up with computers at home my computer journey didn’t 
        really start until the spring of 2008 when I decided to buy a cheap 
        eMachines desktop from Best Buy just to take it apart. Since then 
        I’ve built custom computers, repaired laptops, dabbled with databases, 
        created small webservers, and lots more.  
      </p>  
      <p>
        When I’m not working on something for school I will typically be working 
        on one of my many projects. The current hobby project I’m focusing on is 
        a media center I’ve set up on a Raspberry Pi.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not hanging out in the digital world I like to relax with my 
        wife and daughter.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I've Chosen to Focus on Software Development</h2>

    <div>
        <h2>Why Software</h2>
      <p>
        Of all the areas related to IT, software is the most fascinating to me. 
        Without it all you’re left with is a very expensive paperweight. It is 
        what powers everything in modern society from the smartphone in your pocket, 
        to the rockets we trust to shuttle our astronauts to the International Space 
        Station. Whether retrieving data from a database or working with a server, 
        software is what gives us the power to leverage machines to make our lives easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software development is both calculated and creative. The skills needed to 
        develop software are difficult to obtain but not unattainable by the average 
        person. Yet it is very daunting to most people.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is one of the most powerful tools we have at our fingertips. With software we 
        literally have the power to change the world. Having a computer do what you 
        programmed it to do is very empowering and is something that should be shared 
        with everyone.  
      </p>
